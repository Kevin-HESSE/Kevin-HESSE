# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

## Who I am ?

Passionate web developer, I'm Kevin HESSE. I love to learn and improve my knowledge around the web development. I also create scripts to help me to generate automated files. I develop on linux systems with the help of the WSL technology on Windows.

Every thing began when I needed to create some script to my work. After that, I decided to continue my journey by learning the tools necessary to be a web developper. To improve my knowledge, I study in the O'Clock school. The course helps me on every aspect. Currently, I continue to learn and improve by practising on my differents projects step by step.

I work on the differents languages :
